I am a new student of Fall 2019 pursuing Masters in Applied Computer Science. 

I am from Hyderabad, India. Describing my academic background, Computer education has been a part of my curriculum since secondary school.  My formal introduction to Computer Science & Engineering began in my bachelor's degree at VIGNAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE (VITS). Under its excellent faculty, I got exposed to the entire spectrum of Computer Science and bagged a comprehensive and robust background in Computer Science in an environment that is intensely competitive, and where research goes hand-in-hand with learning. I also got a lot of drill in both theoretical research work and implementation, thus laying a sound foundation for graduate study. My favorite pastime is listening to music, reading, and drawing.

MS in computer science is a professional degree worldwide and it will be easier for me to fulfill my dreams of becoming a software professional and become a successful person.

I would like to study further and learn the latest in computer technologies.
